        I am most proud of my Final project because it is my largest project with all dynamic JavaScript webpages that all perform different functions, including a 1-100 game, a user poll, and a feedback page using FormSpree. I had some trouble understanding the regexes for validating information in one of my webpages, but I figured it out and got it working. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to create aesthetically pleasing, dynamic webpages. I felt prepared for this course because I knew some JavaScript before I took this course, and how to make a webpage with HTML and CSS. If I could do the course again, I would do everything the same because everything has worked out successfully.
